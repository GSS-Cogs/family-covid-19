##### Footnotes

		Please note this release contains provisional data and therefore may not provide a complete picture of recent fishing activity.
		A high volume landing of mackerel by an English vessel has missing data. Therefore, to give a more realistic estimate, the value for this landing has been imputed based on March 2019 mackerel prices


**DM Notes**

Intro													
														
The MMO publishes national statistics on fishing activity across the UK on a monthly basis with a two month lag: 
https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monthly-uk-sea-fisheries-statistics.

In response to COVID-19, the MMO will be publishing an additional ad hoc statistical release with more timely figures on fishing activity data. This will be published monthly while coronavirus continues to have a large impact on the fishing industry.

In publishing more timely data we are accepting a reduction in data quality as the picture of fishing activity may not be complete while data is still being processed. This release is therefore not badged as national statistics, reflecting the temporary nature of the recurring publication and the reduced data quality when compared to our regular monthly national statistics. 

We welcome feedback on this publication. Please submit your comments here: https://forms.gle/Qoaty1byCddJYryb9.
												

**Glossary**	
	
Demersal: Species of demersal fish inhabit the bottom of the ocean. Key demersal species fished by the UK fleet include cod, haddock and whiting. 
	
Pelagic: Pelagic fish inhabit the water column (not near the sea bed or shore). The two main pelagic species fished by the UK fleet are mackerel and herring. 
	
Shellfish: Shellfish include various species of molluscs (e.g. scallops, whelks) and crustaceans (e.g. crabs and nephrops).
	
Number of trips: The number of distinct trips (out from port and back to port) where fish were landed taken by a given group of vessels in a given time frame. The same vessel will account for multiple trips.
	
Admin port: Vessels are registered with specific ports. This is not necessarily where they land all their catches but gives an indication of where vessels are based around the UK and its nations.
	
Value: In this publication the value in Â£000's is reported. This is the value fishers received for their landings at first sale as recorded on sales notes from Registered Buyers and Sellers of fish.
	
Quantity: The quantity in tonnes in reported. This is the live weight of fish caught and landed by fishers.
