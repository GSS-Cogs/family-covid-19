ICD is increasingly used in clinical care and research to define diseases and study disease patterns, as well as manage health care, monitor outcomes and allocate resources. More than 100 countries use the system to report mortality data, a primary indicator of health status. This system helps to monitor death and disease rates worldwide and measure progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. About 70% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health expenditures (USD $ 3.5 billion) are allocated using ICD for reimbursement and resource allocation ICD has been translated into 43 languages.
